    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
      Hi, I’m <strong>Mohib Kohi</strong> — a Seattle-based <strong>Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong> with 7+ years of experience building scalable, reliable, and user-friendly systems. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code, and I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and continuous learning are encouraged.
      <br /><br />
      I’ve had the opportunity to work on high-impact projects across startups and major tech companies like <strong>Microsoft</strong>. My recent work has focused on everything from developing APIs and observability tools to designing data dashboards and improving CI/CD pipelines using modern cloud platforms like <strong>Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>.
      <br /><br />
      I’m fluent in a wide range of languages and frameworks—<strong>Java, C#, TypeScript, React, Node.js, ASP.NET Core, Spring Boot</strong>—and I enjoy switching contexts between backend services and frontend interfaces. Whether it's building out RESTful APIs, analyzing data in <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>, or enhancing user experiences, I bring both depth and versatility to every project.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of work, I’m a proud father, an outdoor enthusiast, and someone who finds balance through hiking, camping, and playing soccer. I’ve also given back to my community by volunteering at local youth centers, where I supported children through mentorship and inclusive events.
      <br /><br />
      If you’re looking to collaborate on a project, talk shop, or just want to say hi—feel free to get in touch.
